          I studied Information Systems at Ball State University and graduated in 2014.  I started working for Liberty Mutual in June of that year as an IT Analyst. Throughout the two years I've worked for Liberty, I have been involved in a variety of things including annual portfolio budgeting and planning, systems analysis, project management, and agile transformation.

        Upon the completion of the Front End Engineering class at The Iron Yard, I will be placed on a new team within Liberty Mutual to work as a front end developer. The team is in the Distribution domain. It is not clear exactly what I will be working on, but I will use the skills I learn in this course to contribute to my new team.

        I have several interests including cooking, running, and spending time with friends and family.  As part of the first homework assignment, I created a page about Crockpot Cooking Recipes - <a href="crockpot-cooking.html">check it out here!</a>
